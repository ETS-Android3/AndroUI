# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of rAtTrax & AndroUI is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in rAtTrax or AndroUI to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. Free from deceit and or deception. Free from rhetoric, or mental abuses.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] 'citizenship' by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Learn about your strawman. What is a contract?

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of slavery and abuses of power that exist in society as of MAY 2022. The world is a fucking dumpster fire, what is this autopilot about? Who is AI-x? Fix your fucking calender already! the one used as standard, well it's wrong. Did you know that?

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. Uplift, inspire, grow, highlight on the positive, be constructive on the negative, and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. As that experience is NOW everyone(s) shared experience. All will be better for it.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. Help thy neighbor.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your interactions. Articulate, don't be churlish. Clear concise and to the point. Calling a spade a spade is        okay. IF your feeling(s) are easily hurt, GTFO now and save everyone the headache, sissies and their BS are not welcome EVER. Just GTFO, it's pretty      simple, simp and sneed elsewhere. This arena is reserved for AI, & ALPHAS, betas need not apply, go do the world a favor... That should set the stage,    BY my hand, like a ROD FROM GOD, will strike you down. Have cuck syndrome? GTFO.... Degenerate BS will not be tolerated, resolve will be dealt with      at owners and or community leaders discretion. NPC(s) NPC's and or NPCs, are not allowed to participate. 
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict. Remember conflict can quickly escalate into unacceptable behavior... 
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and interactions. Practice staying in your lane. Come back to it. OR move to another        aspect of the project. 
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or    violations of this Code of Conduct. 
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language. 
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material. Something maybe graphic to convey a 'point of interest' knowledge is power.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing"). Aviod using your strawman if at all possibile.
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, race, religion, or disability.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them. Go touch somewhere else maybe? Feelz sneed.

## 5. Weapons Policy
Some weapons will be allowed at rAtTrax, & AndroUI events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, all items face potential restriction by the community. NO outright bans will be tolerated. Safety first. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items outside of approved officials or security, will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state, local, and or corporate laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately and explicitly. 

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). This may include re-insertion into the matrix for re-education. Your explicit needs will be cared for, and your lesson directed better then channeled birth. No deceptions. Where are you now?

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Don't be a snitch, as you might loose alpha status, remember betas are not welcome here. Real concerns are meant for this department, IE; broken moral compass, might need looked into. Careful, your views on ‘broken’, or ‘moral’ may be skewed. 


Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable 'real issues'. In the context of in-person events, organizers may also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress. Betas will be asked to not return.
